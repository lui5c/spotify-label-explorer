		<h3>welcome!</h3>
		<p>this web app allows you to explore which labels are represented on a Spotify playlist and which labels an artist has released music on. </p>
		<p>you can use it for whatever you want, but i like to use it to find music related to the things i already listen to. many recent music streaming 
		platforms have made it a central feature in their program or software to integrate "radio" or other song suggestion mechanisms. these predictive playlists/radio stations are based on models of what the user already listen to. however, collections of music that have a similar motif, shared community, or other commonality already tend to be grouped together! they can be found by looking at the discography of a label.</p>
		<h3>labels</h3>
		<p>whenever an album is released, usually there is a "record label" that is credited with "releasing" the album. it's kind of a weird setup, and many bands elect to self-release music, bypassing any bureacracy and hoop-jumping brought on by looping in other people. most of the time, bands work with labels in a symbiotic way, where bands make music, and labels take care of promotion, advertising, maybe booking shows, and maybe getting their record pressed on vinyl for cheaper than it would be without the label. usually, the bands that a label works with all have something in common that made them work with each other.</p>
		<p>there are genre-oriented labels, location-specific labels, reissue labels, labels that only ever see one release, labels that were only in operation for a year and a half, multi-million dollar massive corporation labels, labels that get created whenever someone releases their first and only solo EP through <a href="http://www.distrokid.com/">DistroKid</a>, and any combination of those already mentioned above. it's a way funner way to find music than song suggestions from a streaming service when you finish a playlist!</p>
		<h3>example of how you might find new music</h3>
		<p>say you like a synth-pop band from Paris. you want to go on a synth-pop kick, and want to listen to all of this artist's contemporaries. you can check out "what fans listen to" (which works pretty well), but you want more. you decide to check out their label. you can see all of the albums that have been released by the label that put out that synth-pop album. maybe it turns out that this label only does synth-pop! or maybe it's a Parisian label, and you find a band that is best buddies with your original band, because they're all living within a couple blocks of each other. regardless, you have seen at least a little of a community that exists because of music. labels are really important for scenes to thrive and for small bands to find each other and find people who want to hear their music. Spotify and Apple Music don't have ways for you to explore a label the way they have ways for you to explore artists and collections of playlists. </p>
		<h3>where do i start?!</h3>
		<p>in order to enter/use the label explorer, you need to log in with Spotify &rarr; <a href="/login">log in using Spotify</a> and you will be brought to the site!</p>

		<h3>how to use the label explorer</h3>
		<p>click the search bar to begin your search. you can choose for your search to return artist results, playlist results, or album results (when searching for releases from a particular label). if you click on a playlist, you'll be shown the playlist with each song including the label that it was released on. if you click on an artist, you'll see all of their releases and which label each release was on. sometimes there are duplicate releases, which happens when artists have different record labels for distribution in different countries. by default, twenty results load per search. you can load more at the bottom, and you can open albums, playlists, and artists in spotify. </p>
		<h3>a note about Spotify's indexing of labels</h3>
		<p>currently, there is no way to view a label's discography in Spotify, nor is there a way to retrieve a label's discography using the Spotify Web API, which this site uses. this website uses the closest approximation possible (without indexing Spotify's entire database) which is to type the following into the search bar: <code>label:"sun records"</code>, replacing sun records with whatever record label's results you want to see. on this website, search by just typing the label into the search bar. in Spotify, you have to use the <code>label:""</code> syntax.</p>
